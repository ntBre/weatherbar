#+title: weatherbar

* Description

  =weatherbar= is a simple program for fetching and formatting weather
  information suited for a status bar from [[https://weather.gov][weather.gov]].

* Installation

  Either clone the repository and run

  #+begin_src shell
    go install .
  #+end_src

  inside of it, or run this directly:

  #+begin_src shell
    go install github.com/ntBre/weatherbar@latest
  #+end_src

* Usage
  The intended usage is inside of dwmblocks to put weather in your
  status bar. Below is a minimal blocks.h that only has this block in
  it with an interval of 600 seconds and a signal of RTMIN+12
  associated with it.

  #+begin_src C
    static const Block blocks[] = {
      {"", "weatherbar -f LBF -x 133 -y 37", 600, 12},
    };

    static char delim = '|';
  #+end_src

** Getting Weather

   First, find the latitude and longitude for your location. Use these
   with the following command to get your grid x and y coordinates.

   #+begin_src shell
     curl -X GET "https://api.weather.gov/points/41.64,-91.54" | grep 'grid[XY]'
     # -> "gridX": 33,
     #    "gridY": 70,
   #+end_src

  Then you can set these in your program invocation using the =-f=,
  =-x=, and =-y= flags:

  #+begin_src shell
    weatherbar -f LBF -x 33 -y 70
  #+end_src
